## Introduction

If you ever need to take text like this:

**Fastest drivers' times**

And convert it to something you could use in a URL or filename, such as:

**fastest-drivers-times**

Then here's a simple macOS menubar app that does text transforms such as these with a single click. It just takes the text in the clipboard and replaces it with a filename friendly version.

## Installation

Just download the latest release .zip file, uncompress it and copy `urlify.app` into your Applications folder.
